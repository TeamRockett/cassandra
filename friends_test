<br>
PHOEBE: Wait, does he eat chalk?<br>
<br>
(THE OTHERS STARE, BEMUSED)<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!<br>

dinner and- not having sex.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Sounds like a date to me.<br>
<br>
(CUT TO SAME SET)<br>

CHANDLER: Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the
cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.<br>

<br>
CHANDLER: Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Instead of...?<br>

CHANDLER: That's right.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Never had that dream.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: No.<br>

CHANDLER: All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. And it turns out it's my mother,
which is very weird, because- she never calls me!<br>

(CUT TO SAME SET. ROSS HAS NOW ENTERED)<br>
<br>
ROSS: (MORTIFIED) Hi.<br>
<br>
JOEY: This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Are you okay, sweetie?<br>
<br>
ROSS: I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled
it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Cookie?<br>
<br>
MONICA: (EXPLAINING TO THE OTHERS) Carol moved her stuff out today. (TO ROSS) Let me get
you some coffee.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Ooh! Oh! (STARTS TO PLUCK AT THE AIR JUST IN FRONT OF ROSS)<br>
<br>
ROSS: No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay? I'll be
fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy.<br>
<br>
MONICA: No you don't.<br>
<br>
ROSS: No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!<br>
<br>
JOEY: And you never knew she was a lesbian...<br>
<br>
ROSS: No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I
know?<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... (THE OTHERS STARE AT HIM) Did I say that out
loud?<br>
<br>
JOEY: Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're
hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?<br>
<br>
(ROSS GESTURES HIS CONSENT)<br>

<br>
MONICA: So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room
where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really
gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- (TO WAITRESS, WHO HAS BROUGHT HER
COFFEE)Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by
Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks
like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, he always looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had
to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this
for?'. (TO MONICA) So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I
have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Who wasn't invited to the wedding.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue...<br>

shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said,
'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat!
No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor,
Daddy!<br>
<br>
ROSS: You can see where he'd have trouble.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica. <br>
<br>
MONICA: Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait,
I said maybe!!<br>

y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there
was only one woman- for her...<br>
<br>
JOEY: What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavour
of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavours out there.
There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with
Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You
